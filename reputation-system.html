<h2>Reputation System:</h2>
<p>The Reputation System is a point based system to form alliances between nations. This system will replace the existing "nation ally add" commands. Points, negative or postitive are awarded through player actions with the other nation. These actions can be commerce with the other nation, acts of hostiles such as kill citizens or other various actions to gain/lose points.</p>

	<h4>Reputation Truce:</h4>
		<p>Sometimes issues are resolved but that may not be reflective in the reputation level if it stands below Neutral. This is why a Reputation Truce, an agreeable item conducted by both nation leaders can agree to reset their reputation level to neutral. A sort of "sue for peace" option.</p>
